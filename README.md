# GitHub Reason List

Simple app that displays list of GitHub repositories that contains topic "reasonml".

Started by following this tutorial https://jamesfriend.com.au/a-first-reason-react-app-for-js-developers (highly recommended!)

Added (in comparision to tutorial):
- using graphql github api instead of the rest one (not using [graphql_ppx](https://github.com/mhallin/graphql_ppx) yet ðŸ˜ž)
- some styles (using [glamor](https://github.com/poeschko/bs-glamor) bindings), design stolen from GitHub's "Explore this week" newsletter

Want to add:
- lazy loading (by some button at the bottom or infinite scroll)
